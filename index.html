<h1>Duolingo Review</h1>
<p>Duolingo is one of the most popular language learning websites (and apps) in the world. A lot of people say that it is perfect for someone who wants to learn a language in a few months but is it as good as they say?</p>
  <p>I was using Duolingo app for almost a year. When I started using it, I was impressed by its design. It looked clean and modern, but it also was colourful. I particularly like that you can compete with other students and advance to higher leagues by completing lessons. Duolingo has rather large variety of languages that you can learn but some of them have less functions than more popular ones. For example, German has pictures but Swedish not. I also do not like that sometimes you have to guess answers because there is almost no explanation in lessons. You can click on the words you do not know and get the translation, but the situation is different in e.g. genders + possessions in Swedish. You must guess the variation of ‘his’ or ‘her’ because it depends on gender and there are many exceptions, and you get 0 explanations. I went off Duolingo because of it. I was discouraged.</p>
<p>All in all, I think Duolingo is great app for learners who want to learn simple language. I would not recommend it to people who get discouraged fast. If you want to learn a hard language, you should pay for private lessons and exercise with Duolingo.</p>
